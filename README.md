# Titanic_Kaggle_reviewed

One of my first ML hands-on project was the famous Titanic Kaggle competition, probably as many others Data Science lovers. I loaded the data, dropped some features, performed a Random Forest and my work was done.. :-D

As part of our Machine Learning Homeworks for the MSc in Data Sciences & Business Analytics @CentraleSup√©lec and ESSEC, we had to participate to that challenge. Here is the reviewed Titanic Kaggle competition notebook, including more data exploratory analysis and feature engineering, as well as more models.
